# Quality configuration for statifier_datamodel.
#
#   mix quality                 - full gate: format, compile, credo, dialyzer,
#                                 deps audit, full test suite with coverage.
#                                 Run before every commit.
#
#   mix quality --profile loop  - inner loop while implementing: skips dialyzer
#                                 and coverage, runs only the tests covering
#                                 changed code. Use between edits.
#
# Agents: prefer `--format json --report -` when you want to route on results.
#
# Deliberately smaller than statifier-ex's gate. That repo's custom stages -
# the gate guard, the ADR guard and judge, the regression ratchet - all exist
# to protect a conformance corpus and an accepted ADR set this package does
# not have. Adopting any of them here is a decision to record when there is
# something for it to protect, not a default to inherit.
#
# There is deliberately no .credo.exs either: credo's own defaults under
# --strict are the gate until this package has a reason to deviate from one.
#
# Recorded deviation from the satellite shape - coveralls.json carries
# "treat_no_relevant_lines_as_covered": true on top of the shared
# minimum_coverage: 90. The satellites do not need it because they all have
# executable code; this package is currently a moduledoc-only scaffold, so
# excoveralls sees zero relevant lines and, by default, reports that as 0.0%
# rather than "nothing to cover" - which would fail the 90% bar with no way
# to fix it short of lowering the bar. The flag keeps the threshold at the
# fleet's 90% and only changes the empty-file case. Drop it in the campaign
# that moves the index and the types here: from then on the package has real
# code, the premise lapses, and strict parity with the satellites is the
# default. Carried from the same deviation statifier_blocks and encryptor_ecto
# recorded at their own scaffold stage.
